# Radio using Sveriges Radios API

---

Hyper Island - First Web App

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

The brief was to create a website in vanilla Javascript which we would later remake into React 


### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks (3 weeks for creating the vanilla site)

### :dart: Goals:

This being something I had to rewrite into React later, my focus was to write as readable and maintainable as possible so I could reuse the code.
- Keep on polishing my JS / HTML / CSS skills
- Further improve my API knowledge
- Dig deeper into what makes a website accessible to all users - accessibilty in short
- Try mobile first approach 

### :grimacing: The process:

This project would have been SO much easier if the SR API would have been constructed in a manageable way. My first struggle was having to combine three API endpoints to get the result I was after. The second was finding a way to keep the radio "live". The sound wasn't the issue here, it was trying to figure out when to change image, text and start / end-time for all the different programs / news / podcasts and songs.


### :blue_book: Learnings:

- More knowledge in JS / HTML / CSS
- Deeper understanding of how to work with APIs and multiple endpoints at the same time.
- How to create a custom progress bar
- Working with live audio and schedule
- CSS animations

### :computer: Tech used in this specific repository:

- Github
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Sveriges Radios API
- Dribbble for inspiration
